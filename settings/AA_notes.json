Raw audio quality isn't good, post audio processing 'Clean' and 'De-ess' can clean it up nicely though.\n\nUsage: Set up the text here in this textbox, select your model settings and your directory path. In the input with the placeholder ''Project', 'Project\\SubDirectory' you put your name of the directory to create and use. It saves in the app's directory '\\projects_output\\Project'.

If a chunk fails because of Whisper verification or some processing error, you may have to open your job.json file in the directory and turn down or off the Whisper verification to get past it. Process errors such as clipping could be the text in that chunk is causing some problems.
