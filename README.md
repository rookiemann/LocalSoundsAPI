# LocalSoundsAPI

**The ultimate portable, offline all-in-one audio studio**  
Text-to-Speech · Music Generation · Sound Effects · Video Production · AI Chatbot

**LocalSoundsAPI** gives you both a full-featured **browser-based web interface** and a complete **local REST API** — use it interactively or call it from scripts, other apps, or automation tools.

Everything runs locally from one folder — no installation, no internet needed after setup.

### Included Engines (all fully local & offline)
- **XTTS v2** – Top-tier multilingual voice cloning with speaker embeddings
- **Fish Speech** – Extremely fast and expressive cloned voices
- **Kokoro 82M** – Lightning-fast English TTS with 20 premium built-in voices
- **Stable Audio Open 1.0** – Text-to-music and sound effects (CLAP-scored variants)
- **ACE-Step 3.5B** – Advanced multi-line prompt music generation (style + lyrics)
- **Whisper** – On-demand transcription & quality verification for every generated chunk
- **Local LLM Chatbot** – Built-in llama.cpp assistant for writing prompts, scripts, lyrics, stories, and full projects
- **OpenRouter / LM Studio support** – Optional cloud or external local backends for the chatbot


## Key Features
- **Professional post-processing on every engine**  
  De-reverb, de-essing, loudness normalization (-23 LUFS), intelligent silence trimming, peak limiting, and optional Whisper verification with automatic retries.

- **Full project system**  
  Save jobs with progress tracking, automatic recovery (`##recover##`), and persistent `job.json` files.

- **Powerful built-in Chatbot**  
  Helps you write perfect prompts, lyrics, stories, or entire scripts. Responses can be sent directly to any TTS or music engine with one click.

- **Per-model device selection**  
  Every model (XTTS, Fish, Kokoro, Stable Audio, ACE-Step, Whisper, local LLM) can be loaded on CPU or any available GPU independently — perfect for mixing heavy and light models.

- **Run multiple instances**  
  Use `(portable) LocalSoundsAPI-Multi.bat` to launch several copies on different ports — great for parallel generation or different model setups.

- **Video production tool**  
  Turn any audio + transcription into a subtitled video (horizontal/vertical, solid color, transparent, or image/video background).

- **Settings presets** – Save and load all your favorite parameters instantly.

## Quick Start – Fully Portable (No Installation)

1. **Download the repository code**  
   Go to the main repo → Code → Download ZIP.  
   Extract it to any folder you like (e.g., Desktop, Documents, or a USB drive). This is your main project folder.

2. **Download the portable binaries from Releases**  
   Go to [Releases](https://github.com/rookiemann/LocalSoundsAPI/releases/latest) and download:  
   - `portable-python-env-v1.7z`  
   - `bin.zip`

3. **Extract the binaries correctly**  
   - Extract `portable-python-env-v1.7z` **directly into your main project folder** → it creates the `python/` subfolder.  
   - Extract `bin.zip` **into the existing `bin/` folder** (inside your main project folder) → it populates `bin/ffmpeg/`, `bin/rubberband/`, and `bin/espeak-ng/`.

4. **Launch the app**  
   - **Single instance (recommended for most users):**  
     Double-click `(portable) LocalSoundsAPI-Single.bat`  
     → It always starts on port **5006** and opens http://127.0.0.1:5006 in your browser.

   - **Multiple instances (for running several generations in parallel):**  
     Double-click `(portable) LocalSoundsAPI-Multi.bat`  
     → It will ask you:  
       • How many instances do you want?  
       • Starting from which port? (e.g., 5006, 5007, 5008...)  
     Each instance gets its own port and browser tab.

**First run only:** The app auto-downloads all models (~8–12 GB total). This happens once and can take 10–40 minutes. Just let it finish.

That's it – completely offline and portable after the first run!

## Important Folders
- `models/` – Place or auto-download TTS/music models here
- `voices/` – Your reference voice samples for cloning
- `projects_output/` – All saved jobs and final outputs
- `brain/` – Chatbot history, archives, and system prompts
- `settings/` – Your saved parameter presets
- `bin/` – Bundled ffmpeg, rubberband, eSpeak-ng
- `python/` – Complete portable Python environment

## Why This Feels So Smooth
- **Completely self-contained** – The bundled portable Python environment is isolated from your system Python. No pip installs, no conda environments, no dependency conflicts, no PATH headaches. Just extract and run.
- **Truly offline** – After the initial model downloads (which you can do once), everything works 100% without internet.
- **No admin rights needed** – Perfect for work/school computers or USB stick setups.
- **Instant multi-GPU support** – Load heavy models on your best GPU and lighter ones (Whisper, Kokoro, Fish) on another or on CPU — all from the same interface.

### Tips for the Best Experience
- **First run?** Let the app auto-download the models you need (XTTS, Fish, Kokoro, Stable Audio, ACE-Step, CLAP, Whisper). It only happens once per model.
- **Low VRAM?** Use the per-model device selectors — keep big models on your strongest GPU and run Whisper/Kokoro on CPU or a smaller card.
- **Want to generate faster?** Launch multiple instances with `LocalSoundsAPI-Multi.bat` — one for TTS, one for music, one for the chatbot, etc.
- **Chatbot for content creation** – Stuck on a prompt or lyric? Ask the built-in assistant — then click the little icons under its reply to send the text straight to XTTS, Fish, Kokoro, Stable Audio, or ACE-Step.
- **Save everything you like** – Use the “Save Path” field to create permanent projects in `projects_output/`. Temporary generations disappear when you close the app (unless saved).

Enjoy a clean, powerful, completely local creative workflow — no cloud, no subscriptions, no compromises! 🎧✨
